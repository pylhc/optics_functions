Twiss Files are from a default LHC lattice with assigned a2b2-a6b6 errors
and crossing scheme.

The lattice is not sliced (i.e. a thick lattice) and hence will not work
to check against PTC-RDTs!
To compute analytically RDTs in crossing scenario exact enough to compare to
PTC-RDT calculations, one needs a sliced (i.e. thin) lattice!
